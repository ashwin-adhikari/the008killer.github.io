## Web/Blogler
![web-blogler](assets/blogler.png)

There was a login and register page and after registering a user we get into this web page where we have config editor which seems to take in yaml configuration and another upload blog section.

### Analysing the contents of blogler.zip

```

The core vulnerability in this challenge lies in a logic flaw within the ```validate_conf``` function combined with the behavior of the ``display_name`` function and ***YAML anchors***.
![Blogler bug](assets/blogler_bug.png)

#### Vulnerability
- LFI Check Bypass: The ```validate_conf``` function attempts to prevent Path Traversal by checking if the string ```../``` exists in the filename and ensuring the resolved path stays within the blogs directory. However, it only validates the state of the configuration at that moment.
- Shared object via YAML Anchors: Using YAML anchors (```&``` and ```*```), we can make a blog entry and the user configuration point to the same dictionary object in memory.
- Bypassing ```display_name()```: The ```display_name``` function capitalizes each part and joins them,  If a part starts with a non-alphabetical character (like ```.``` or ```/```), ```capitalize()``` does nothing. By using a sequence like ```.._/_```, we can construct a path traversal string that doesn't contain the literal ```../``` (thus bypassing the check)

#### Exploit

```yaml
blogs:
  - &exploit
    title: "Flag"
    name: "_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_./flag"
user: *exploit
```
-  The string ```_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_.._/_./flag``` does not contain ```../```. During validation, pathlib treats the underscores as part of the directory names.
-  Because of the YAML anchor (```&exploit``` and ```*exploit```), the user object and the first blog object are the same dictionary in memory.
- ```display_name()``` function splits by ```_``` into ```['', '..', '/', '..', '/', '..', '/', '..', '/', '..', '/', '..', '/', './flag']```.
- It capitalizes each letter but  ```..```, and ```/``` remain unchanged. ```./flag``` remains ```./flag``` (because it starts with a dot).
It joins them into: ```../../../../../.././flag.```
- And we get the ```flag```

## Crypto/Smol Cats

I was a straight forward challenge gave us ```modulus(n)```, ```cipher(c)``` and ```public exponent(e)``` and we have to decode cipher and give it ```message(m)``` in hex.

![instance](assets/smolcats_instance.png)

I used [factor.db](https://factordb.com) to find the factors of the modulus.

### Solution
- Submit the Proof of work and copy and paste the n, c and e
- calculate factors of n

```python
# copy and paste n,c, e from the instance
n = 605209181152683570305169059628442346702992350480092763486139
e = 65537
c = 466838744699655278218446173999183015046193150877209850221109


# from factordb calculate factors of n
p = 710534900243921085712136360791
q = 851765593702603463836875015229


phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
m = pow(c, d, n)

print(m)

# output: 216414036956796911789754134326510711369461877745009347782076
# submit this value
```

## Misc/Cat Bomb!
![cat bomb](assets/catbomb.png)

This was an OSINT challenge, we have ```cat-bomb.jpeg``` which shows us the location where photograph was taken.
![given image](assets/cat-bomb.jpeg)

Using reverse image search we got the location of the image.
![location](assets/catbomb_location.png)

Using Google maps to pinpoint the location. After much digging around ```Google Street View``` in Fushimi Inari Shrine, I finally found the exact location
![Pinpoint](assets/catbomb_solve.png)

To get the exact digits, the maps has that exact 7 decimal places in the url portion:
```<REDACTED>/@34.9681538,135.7773153<REDACTED>```
